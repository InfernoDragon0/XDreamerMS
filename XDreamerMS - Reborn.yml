Note: Put a # behind whatever is a NEW suggestion. Examples can be seen here:

Kit Command: Gives level 30 equipment when reaching level 30 (Suggested by: InfernoDragon0) [Assigned to InfernoDragon0]
[This example shows the suggestion title, the description, and the suggested by. This is a FINISHED suggestion, meaning no # is needed]

#GM Help command: Calls for a gm for immediate help. (Suggested by: InfernoDragon0) [Assigned to InfernoDragon0]
[This example makes the whole line green, which means this is a NEW suggestion.]
